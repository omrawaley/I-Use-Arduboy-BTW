# I Use Arduboy BTW
An endless game made for the Arduboy Meme Game Jam. Based off of the "I use Arch Linux BTW" [meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/btw-i-use-arch).

## Goal
Tell as many people as you can that you use the Arduboy Distro and that they cannot even come close to comprehending the power and knowledge which you have. 
However, be prepared to use your invisible legs as, once you creep them out, they will run away!

Try to get the "Weirdo Level" counter as high as you can.
